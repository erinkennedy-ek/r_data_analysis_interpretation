# r_data_analysis_interpretation
This repository contains R scripts and R Markdown files for data analysis and interpretation tasks as part of the MSc Data Analytics program. The work focuses on analysing property and car datasets, cleaning data, and preparing it for modelling. It includes various techniques for data exploration, visualisation, and preprocessing.

Part One: Property Data Analysis
    Dataset: PropertyDataset1.csv
    R Markdown File: Q1_analysis.Rmd
    Tasks:
        Filter and analyse property data from the first dataset.
        Create various visualisations using ggplot2, including bar charts and plots.

Part Two: Data Preparation and Modeling
    Datasets: PropertyDataset1.csv, PropertyDataset2.csv
    R Markdown File: Q2_analysis.Rmd
    PDF Report: Q2_analysis.pdf
    Screencast: View Screencast (not linked)
    Tasks:
        Clean and prepare both datasets for modelling.
        Perform exploratory data analysis, create additional variables, and provide visualizations.
        Prepare a comprehensive PDF report outlining data preparation steps and findings.
        Record a screencast and create a PowerPoint presentation explaining the analysis.

Part Three: Car Data Cleaning
    Dataset: CarsDataset.csv
    R Markdown File: Q3_analysis.Rmd
    Tasks:
        Clean the car dataset, ensuring all rows are complete and free of missing values.
        Document the cleaning process and provide an explanation of each step.

In reflection, I recognize that the code and analyses in this project can be improved based on my current knowledge and experience. I have chosen to leave the original code as-is for those who might find it useful for practice and learning purposes.

Thank you for exploring this project!
